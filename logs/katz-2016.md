## [Programming by poking: why MIT stopped teaching SCIP (Yarden Katz, 2016)](http://www.posteriorscience.net/?p=206){:target="_blank"}

In [this talk](https://vimeo.com/151465912#t=59m36s) at the NYC Lisp meetup, Gerry Sussman was asked why MIT stopped teaching the legendary 6.001 course, which was based on Sussman and Abelson’s classic text [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp). Sussman’s answer was that: (1) he and Hal Abelson got tired of teaching it (having done it since the 1980s). So in 1997, they walked into the department head’s office and said: _"We quit. Figure out what to do."_ And more importantly, (2) that they felt that the SICP curriculum no longer prepared engineers for what engineering is like today. Sussman said that in the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems.

Today, this is no longer the case. Sussman pointed out that engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don’t fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. According to Sussman, his students spend most of their time reading manuals for these libraries to figure out how to stitch them together to get a job done. He said that programming today is _“More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, ‘Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?’”_. The “analysis-by-synthesis” view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.

As to why they chose Python as an alternative, Sussman joked that it was “late binding” decision. Python has a ton of libraries that make it applicable to many types of projects that instructors might want to assign (like writing software to control a robot.)

> What should we consider fundamental?

A fair question, and a full answer would be too long for a comment (though it would fit in a blog post, which I'll go ahead and write now since this seems to be an issue). But I'll take a whack at the TL;DR version here.

AI, ML, and NLP and web design are application areas, not fundamentals. (You didn't list computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, embedded systems -- all applications, not fundamentals.)

You can cover all the set theory and graph theory you need in a day. Most people get this in high school. The stuff you need is just not that complicated. You can safely skip category theory.

What you do need is some amount of time spent on the idea that computer programs are mathematical objects which can be reasoned about mathematically. This is the part that the vast majority of people are missing nowadays, and it can be a little tricky to wrap your brain around at first. You need to understand what a fixed point is and why it matters.

You need automata theory, but again, the basics are really not that complicated. You need to know about Turing-completeness, and that in addition to Turing machines there are PDAs and FSAs. You need to know that TMs can do things that PDAs can't (like parse context-sensitive grammars), and that PDAs can to things that FSAs can't (like parse context-free grammars) and that FSAs can parse regular expressions, and that's all they can do.

You need some programming language theory. You need to know what a binding is, and that there are two types of bindings that matter: lexical and dynamic. You need to know what an environment is (a mapping between names and bindings) and how environments are chained. You need to know how evaluation and compilation are related, and the role that environments play in both processes. You need to know the difference between static and dynamic typing. You need to know how to compile a high-level language down to an RTL.

For operating systems, you need to know what a process is, what a thread is, some of the ways in which parallel processes lead to problems, and some of the mechanisms for dealing with those problems, including the fact that some of those mechanisms require hardware support (e.g. atomic test-and-set instructions).

You need a few basic data structures. Mainly what you need is to understand that what data structures are really all about is making associative maps that are more efficient for certain operations under certain circumstances.

You need a little bit of database knowledge. Again, what you really need to know is that what databases are really all about is dealing with the architectural differences between RAM and non-volatile storage, and that a lot of these are going away now that these architectural differences are starting to disappear.

That's really about it.
