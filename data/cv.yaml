  about:
    - "I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [Statistical Inference and Machine Learning (SIML)](https://siml.kaist.ac.kr/) laboratory in KAIST AI, advised by [Juho Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Py4URJUAAAAJ). My research is grounded in the philosophy that [_today's posterior is tomorrow's prior_](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611970654), where __*the current model serves as the foundational prior for the next generation of models.*__"
    - "The rapid evolution of deep learning has established pre-trained [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model) as the bedrock of modern AI systems. As this landscape continues to evolve, I focus on investigating how to effectively transfer, adapt, and compress their knowledge to catalyze the development of future models that are stronger in capability and lighter in cost. My research covers [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning), [knowledge distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation), and [model compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_compression)."
    - "Beyond my own research, I am deeply committed to contributing to the academic community through rigorous peer review. Since 2022, I have regularly reviewed for major AI venues such as ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR. I was honored to be recognized as a Top Reviewer at NeurIPS for three consecutive years (2022-2024)."
