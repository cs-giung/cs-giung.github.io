  - title: "The machine of speculative knowledge"
    authors: "Jonathan Swift, 1726"
    url: "/reading/Swift1726"
    note: "The most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study."

  - title: "Not a vox populi, but a vox expertorum"
    authors: "Francis Galton & F. H. Perry-Coste, 1907"

    note: "I heartily wish that the case were otherwise."

  - title: "The function of the machine"
    authors: "George Orwell, 1937"
    url: "/reading/Orwell1937"
    note: "The machine would even encroach upon the activities we now class as 'art';"

  - title: "Aspects of scientific method"
    authors: "George Box, 1976"
    url: "/reading/Box1976"
    note: "Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a \"correct\" one by excessive elaboration."

  - title: "Bayesian inference for the applied statistician"
    authors: "Donald Rubin, 1984"
    url: "/reading/Rubin1984"
    note: "Consequently \"known\" refers to values that are both available and considered worthwhile to include in model specifications."

  - title: "What a scientific theory is"
    authors: "Stephen Hawking, 1988"
    url: "/reading/Hawking1988"
    note: "Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis: you can never prove it."

  - title: "Architecture astronauts"
    authors: "Joel Spolsky, 2001"
    url: "/reading/Spolsky2001"
    note: "When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen."

  - title: "A brief history of statistical learning"
    authors: "Gareth James et al., 2013"
    url: "/reading/James2013"
    note: "Though the term statistical learning is fairly new, many of the concepts that underline the field were developed long ago."

  - title: "When people feared computers"
    authors: "Adrienne LaFrance, 2015"
    url: "/reading/LaFrance2015"
    note: "Don't forget that you're in charge, not the computer."

  - title: "Why MIT stopped teaching SICP"
    authors: "Yarden Katz & Ron Garret, 2016"
    url: "/reading/Katz2016"
    note: "The \"analysis-by-synthesis\" view of SICP became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking."

  - title: "Discussion of Software 2.0"
    authors: "Andrej Karpathy & Dogan Ulus, 2017"
    url: "/reading/Karpathy2017"
    note: "So we need to design neural networks to work with other solutions, not to eradicate."

  - title: "The limitations of deep learning, and its future"
    authors: "François Chollet, 2017"
    url: "/reading/Chollet2017"
    note: "In general, anything that requires long-term planning, and algorithmic-like data manipulation, is out of reach for deep learning models, no matter how much data you throw at them."

  - title: "The bitter lesson"
    authors: "Richard Sutton, 2019"
    url: "/reading/Sutton2019"
    note: "We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run."

  - title: "The grammar according to West"
    authors: "Douglas West"

    note: "I have been accumulating observations about writing mathematics for many years."

  - title: "The illustrated guide to a Ph.D."
    authors: "Matt Might"
    url: "https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/"
    note: "Every fall, I explain to a fresh batch of Ph.D. students what a Ph.D. is. It's hard to describe it in words. So, I use pictures."

  - title: "You and Your Research"
    authors: "Richard Hamming & James Kaiser, 1986"
    url: "/YouAndYourResearch.pdf"
    note: "Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?"

  - title: "Advice to a young mathematician"
    authors: "Michael Atiyah et al., 2008"
