IMPORTANT NOTE: Every masculine gender of the Republic of Korea shall faithfully perform military service, as prescribed by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and the Military Service Act ([Article 3(1) of the Military Service Act](https://elaw.klri.re.kr/eng_service/lawView.do?lang=ENG&hseq=25744){:target="_blank"}). Accordingly, I am set to start my role as a Technical Research Personnel on March 1, 2024. The Technical Research Personnel program offers an alternative way of fulfilling military service obligations, allowing designated research institutes (such as KAIST in my case) under the Military Manpower Administration to employ research personnel to contribute to advancing science and technology in Korea. Consequently, I expect to complete my doctoral degree by February 28, 2026.
